this assignement was quite challenging and full of issues when it comes to the delivery for me. 
i tried trough the modules given to understand how project testing works, but it wasÂ´t helping much, i used chatgpt and some of the things i understood. 
but even with the tools i did not know what i was doing much or if it was working, i had issues with my commits and to open a Pull Request, i ended up needing assistance from talitha/marvin and missed the deadline.
